To build you need curl and nlohmann-json library.
Then simply run "make" command.

By default the program compiles with debug flags. To produce optimized binaries, change FLAGS variable in makefile
from
FLAGS	?= $(DFLAGS) $(LFLAGS)
to
FLAGS	?= $(OFLAGS) $(LFLAGS)

if you break the program, run commands:
make clean
make
